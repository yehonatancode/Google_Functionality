When dealing with web application tests, automation becomes a necessity. 
In this brief project I attempted to test every developer day-to-day tool: Google Search.

The code is a simple implementation of a functional test using the Selenium framework. The test case automates the process of searching for "Albert Einstein" on Google and then selects the suggestion "Albert Einstein IQ".

The code uses the Page Object Model design pattern, which is a design pattern in Selenium for creating an object-oriented representation of a web page.
